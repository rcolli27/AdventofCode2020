Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the problems put together in the 2020 advent of code challenge. They may not be perfect as I programmed most of these as solutions to a problem, rather than a full project. There are most likely algorithms that could be improved or made more efficient, but these programs are my first working version. 

I will most likely not update any of these programs to be made more efficient but I want to store them so that I have something to show later on.
